waitForSlurmQ(targetLength = 0, secsToWait = 30, maxWaits = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetLength}{How many runs to leave in the queue.Default is 0.}

\item{secsToWait}{How many seconds to wait between parsing the queue. Default is 30.}

\item{maxWaits}{Maximum number of times the wait should happen before timing out. Default is 20.

\description{
A function that waits for the SLURM queue to be smaller than a
target number of runs. Typically used to wait for a run that your
code has kicked off before parsing results. Will print messages
with how many runs it waits for and for how long. The wait will
time out after ( secsToWait * maxWaits ) seconds.
