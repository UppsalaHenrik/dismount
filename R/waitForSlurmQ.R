#' Wait for the SLURM queue to empty
#'
#' A function that waits for the SLURM queue to be smaller than a
#' target number of runs. Typically used to wait for a run that your
#' code has kicked off before parsing results. Will print messages
#' with how many runs it waits for and for how long. The wait will
#' time out after ( secsToWait * maxWaits ) seconds.
#'
#' @param targetLength How many runs to leave in the queue.Default is 0.
#' @param secsToWait How many seconds to wait between parsing the queue. Default is 30.
#' @param maxWaits Maximum number of times the wait should happen before timing out. Default is 20.
